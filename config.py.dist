# Hostname on your DynDns Service, which should be updated
dynDnsHostName = "dyndnshost.yourdomain.com"
# Username
username = "yourUser"
# Password
password = "yourPassword"



# Define your Update-String. Allowed variables:
# - <dynDnsHostName>
# - <username>
# - <password>
# - <ipAddress>
# The String depends on your dyndns Provider. Example for informaniak.com:
# https://infomaniak.com/nic/update?hostname=subdomain.yourdomain.com&myip=1.2.3.4&username=XXX&password=XXX

# Which results in the following updateUrl:
# https://infomaniak.com/nic/update?hostname=<dynDnsHostName>&myip=<ipAddress>&username=<username>&password=<password>
updateUrl = "https://infomaniak.com/nic/update?hostname=<dynDnsHostName>&myip=<ipAddress>&username=<username>&password=<password>"

# successMessage is a list containing one or more strings that are expected to be returned by the dyndns service in case of a successful update.
